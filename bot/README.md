# Documentation

This documentation provides instructions for setting up and running the bot that interacts with the Telegram API and Ethereum blockchain. The bot is designed to be run using the `yarn ts-node` command and can be deployed using Docker and Fly.io. It requires the following environment variables: `BOT_TOKEN` for the Telegram chat key and `SECRET_KEY` for the Ethereum wallet secret key.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Yarn
- Docker (for Docker configuration)
- Flyctl CLI (for Fly.io configuration)

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To run the bot successfully, you need to provide two environment variables:

1. `BOT_TOKEN`: This is your Telegram Bot API token. You can obtain it by creating a bot on Telegram and obtaining the token from the BotFather.
2. `SECRET_KEY`: This is the secret key of the Ethereum wallet that the bot will use for interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.

Make sure to keep these keys secure and do not share them publicly.

## Running the Bot Locally

Follow these steps to run the bot locally:

1. Clone the Git repository containing the bot's source code.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following content:

```
BOT_TOKEN=<your-telegram-chat-token>
SECRET_KEY=<your-ethereum-secret-key>
```

4. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory.
5. Run the following commands:

```sh
yarn install
yarn ts-node bot/index.ts
```

To containerize the bot using Docker, see the Dockerfile at the root of the repository.
To deploy the bot to fly.io, see the fly configuration file at the root of the repository.
